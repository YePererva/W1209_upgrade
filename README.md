# W1209 modification

This repository contains my vision of modification widely used W1209 thermostat.

Here, I want to introduce following changes:
- add "universal" schematic to use with either:
  - 10-20K NTC (as original W1209)
  - DS18B20
  - TMP36 and alike
- add a capacitor for RESET line of to prevent self-restart\
  as reported here: [1](https://sampawno.ru/viewtopic.php?f=120&t=13251)
